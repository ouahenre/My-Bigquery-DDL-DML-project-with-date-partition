# My-Bigquery-DDL-DML-project-with-partitions
In BigQuery, partitions are used to optimize storage and query performance on large tables. Partitioning divides a table's data into smaller, manageable segments, often based on a date or timestamp column.

We'll look at two types of request:
- DDL: data definition language
-DML: data manipulation language

Both of these queries use the date partition type. There are two other types of partition, but we won't be looking at them in this little project:
- partitioning by integer
-partitioning by date ingestion
